        Tired of rewriting the same generic CRUD routes? Need to rapidly prototype a feature for a presentation
        or a hackathon? Thankfully, [fastapi-crudrouter](https://github.com/awtkns/fastapi-crudrouter) has your back. As an 
        extension to the APIRouter included with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), the FastAPI CRUDRouter will automatically
        generate and document your CRUD routes for you, all you have to do is pass your model and maybe your database connection.
        
        FastAPI-CRUDRouter is also **lighting fast**, well tested, and **production ready**.
        
        
        ## Installation
        ```bash
        pip install fastapi-crudrouter
        ```
        
        ## Basic Usage
        Below is a simple example of what the CRUDRouter can do. In just ten lines of code, you can generate all 
        the crud routes you need for any model.  A full list of the routes generated can be found [here](./routing).
        
        ```python
        from pydantic import BaseModel
        from fastapi import FastAPI
        from fastapi_crudrouter import MemoryCRUDRouter as CRUDRouter
        
        class Potato(BaseModel):
            id: int
            color: str
            mass: float
        
        app = FastAPI()
        app.include_router(CRUDRouter(schema=Potato))
        ```
        
        ## OpenAPI Support
        By default, all routes generated by the CRUDRouter will be documented according to OpenAPI spec.
        
        Below are the default routes created by the CRUDRouter shown in the generated OpenAPI documentation.

        The CRUDRouter is able to dynamically generate detailed documentation based on the models given to it.
